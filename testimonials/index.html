    <p>"Jessica is a top performer. She always is meticulous working her projects for all the classes
      she has taken with me including Java/Android/Python. A real go-getter and a super personality.
      Definitely a plus for anyone hiring Jessica!"</p>

    <p>"I am very impressed with your continued growth in my classes. Your projects, in the innovation
      class and the entrepreneurship class, were some of the best thought through pieces of work.
      It was clear to me that your group had a sense of camaraderie which is difficult to achieve,
      and clearly you played a very positive role in making it happen. I have no doubt you have a
      great career ahead of you!"</p>

    <p>"The spirit to never leave a problem unsolved came across to me in her work. When others would
      think something was good enough, her attention to detail and to finish the job really stood out
      and was a welcome sign of a desire to work hard. This desire goes beyond just "hard work." It also
      includes an enjoyment of learning new technologies. This kind of hard working and investigative
      spirit would be a benefit to any company willing to have her."</p>
