COM 421 Personal Site

For my professional website, I went for an entrepreneurial feel. As you can see from the menu, I initially planned to have 4 pages: home, about, resume, and accolades. On my home page, I stated my course of study and what I aspire to do after completing my studies. I also added a photo of myself giving a speech, making the home page more personable. At the top of my page, I used flex-box to put my title and my headshot side by side. For my resume page, I replicated the pdf version of my resume, with the addition of my relative courses. I changed the color theme of my resume because the orange, light pink, and blue are from a color palette; these colors compliment each other well. For my accolades page, I took screenshots of my earned badges and quoted statements from my former professor. I used flex-box to have these elements next to each other. Additionally, I have my footer is one all pages with links to my youtube, GitHub, and LinkedIn with their colored icons. 


I am satisfied with the aesthetics of my page, but I did not get a chance to finish all of the content, specifically my about page. I have left the page there with filler text and plan to finish it up in the near future with more information about my volunteering experiences and projects.  


I have run all my HTML pages through a validator and all of my CSS is in one file to help with consistency throughout the site.
